<p>This is one of my favorite Disney movies. The songs are all really good and the character's are cute. The story is a nice take on the story of rapunzel. I mostly like it because of the songs</p>
<h2>Harry Potter</h2>

<p>Just like the books, the movies for this series are great. It is fun to watch the character's grow up throughout the series. Emma Watson is one of my favorite actress's. It is a series that you can enjoy at any age.</p>
