<h1><b><u>My Favorite Movies</u></b></h1>
<h2>1. Mean Girls</h2>
<img src="img/mean-girls.jpg"width="200px">
<p>Mean Girls is one of my favorite comedy movies. It is one of those things that you can watch over and over and over again. It is extremely funny. The characters are great and there are a lot of quotable moments.</p>
<h2>2. Tangled</h2>
<img src="img/Tangled_poster.jpg"width="300px">
<p>This is one of my favorite Disney movies. The songs are all really good and the characters are cute. The story is a nice take on the story of Rapunzel. It makes you feel good when you watch it and since it's a Disney movie it is not overly serious.</p>
<h2>3. Harry Potter Series</h2>
<img src="img/Harry-potter.png"width="400px">
<p>Just like the books, the movies for this series are great. It is fun to watch the character's grow up throughout the series. Emma Watson is one of my favorite actress's. It is a series that you can enjoy at any age. It is always fun to binge watch all of the movies, every once in a while.</p>
