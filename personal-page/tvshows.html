<h1>Favorite TV Shows</h1>
<h2>Modern Family</h2>
<img src="img/modern-family.png"width="300px">
<p>Modern Family is my favorite comedy TV show. It has a good mix of seriousness and comedy. Even though it is a funny show, it still has a storyline. There are a lot of great characters and a lot of things I can relate to.</p>
<h2>Once Upon A Time</h2>
<img src="img/once-upon.jpg"width="300px">
<p> This show is really great because it has a mix of fairytales and real life issues in it. It is very creative in how they twist common fairytales to fit into a complex storyline. It is filled with drama, romance, and action. I love fairytales and this is a more serious version of lighthearted fairytales.</p>
<h2>Pretty Little Liars</h2>

<p>This is a great drama. I like all of the mystery involved in it. Whenever you think you know what will happen there is always some type of shock. After watching each episode you are left with many questions left to be answered.</p>
