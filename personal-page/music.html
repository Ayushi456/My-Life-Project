<h1><u>Favorite Music</u></h1>
<h2>1. Lana Del Rey</h2>
<img src="img/lanadelrey.jpg"width="450px">
<p>All of Lana Del Rey's music has a story which I like. I like that she has both upbeat and more mellow songs. Her music always has a good beat and melody to it.
<h2>2. Melanie Martinez</h2>

<p>Melanie Martinez has a very creative take on pop music. Her entire album is one big story which I think is very creative and each song tells a story in a unique way. She uses a lot of metaphors and personification in her music.</p>
<h2>3. Years and Years</h2>

<p>This is one of my favorite bands. They use a lot of good beats in their music. I really like the lead singer's voice. I especially like their song's "Desire" and "Take Shelter"</p>
