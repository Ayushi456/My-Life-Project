<h1>Favorite Music</h1>
<h2>Lana Del Rey</h2>
<img src="img/lanadelrey.jpg">
<p>All of Lana Del Rey's music has a story which I like. I like that she has both upbeat and more mellow songs. Her music always has a good beat and melody to it.
<h2>Melanie Martinez</h2>
<img src="img/melaniemartinez.jpg"width="300px">
<p>Melanie Martinez has a very creative take on pop music. Her entire album is one big story which I think is very creative and each song tells a story in a unique way. She uses a lot of metaphors and personification in her music.</p>
<h2>Years and Years</h2>
<img src="img/yearsandyears.jpg">
<p>This is one of my favorite bands. They use a lot of good beats in their music. I really like the lead singer's voice. I especially like their song's "Desire" and "Take Shelter"</p>
